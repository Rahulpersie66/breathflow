## Overview
Breathflow promotes mental health and well-being by combining tai chi, yoga, and qigong exercises with advanced AI features. The app dynamically recommends exercises based on user inputs, such as mobility level, experience, and mental health goals.

### Key Features
- **Personalized Exercise Recommendations**: Exercises are selected based on mental health goals (e.g., reducing anxiety or increasing mindfulness), mobility level, and user experience.
- **AI Posture Analysis**: Advanced AI tools assess user posture during tai chi and yoga movements, giving personalized feedback to help improve form and overall benefits.
- **AI Video Analysis**: Users can upload their practice videos, and the app assigns a grade based on how well the user's performance matches a reference video.
